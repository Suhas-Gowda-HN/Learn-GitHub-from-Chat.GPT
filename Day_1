## 🔍 What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that helps me:
- Track changes to files over time.
- Go back to previous versions if needed.
- Collaborate with others safely.

🧠 Analogy:
Like saving backup copies of my homework every day—so if I make a mistake, I can go back to yesterday’s version.

👨‍💻 Git is a version control system.
📦 GitHub is where I store Git projects online.
